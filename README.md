# Introduction

This library is used to load glyphs from a FreeType font and transform
them into meshes of triangles. Specifically, these can be useful to render
the fonts at any scale, save the fonts in SVG format, or use the mesh in
OpenGL/D3D.


# Origin

The library math and basics on how to get the data from the FreeType library
are based on the [ftgles](https://github.com/cdave1/ftgles) project. You may
be interested by that project if you're looking for code that _instantely_
work on a smartphone or an OpenGL environment.
